# pyDist
This code was developed to make parallel python code easier
 to implement. pyDist allows users to simply and efficiently
 distribute python functions or scripts to computers on the
 same network. In the future pyDist will also allow for
 communication between processes similar to that of mpi, but
 a much simpler interface will be used and objects will be
 passed as messages.
